<h1 align="center">USOS Discord Rich Presence</h1>

A simple C++ executable which shows up as an activity in [Discord](https://discord.com/) when run.
The activity contains information about current classes and/or lectures when linked to your [USOS](https://www.usos.edu.pl/) timetable.

## Building and running

Dependencies to install before building:
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) â‰¥ 3.22
* Preferred build system, e.g. [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) or [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

First, clone the repository to your hard drive:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Kacper0510/usos-rpc
$ cd usos-rpc
```

To prepare the build, run the following commands:
```sh
usos-rpc$ mkdir build
usos-rpc$ cd build
usos-rpc/build$ cmake ..
```

Then, run your build system, for example:
```sh
usos-rpc/build$ ninja usos-rpc
```

Finally, run the executable that was generated in the `bin` directory.
